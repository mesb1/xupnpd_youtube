  It uses youtube-dl project too. You need get updated version for yourself.
  
  Example:
  
   - Get server: centos 6 32 bit was cheapest vm we can get. (at first look minimal centos 7 x64 works fine too)
   - Run: yum update
   - Install screen: yum install screen
   - Run: curl -L https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
   - Run youtube-dl to check its ok or maybe need some additional packages.
   - Put yt-proxy and corrupted.mp4 to filesystem.
   - Login to server, run screen, inside screen run yt-proxy like this: ./yt-proxy 8484 and detach from screen.
   - Check firewall settings for port 8484 tcp to be open.
   - Change 2 server address inside xupnpd_youtube file section: videourl =

## youtube-dl

  Great project, please get updated one for yourself, it is used with yt-proxy only: http://yt-dl.org/
  
## yt-dlp

  Another great project, please get updated one for yourself: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/
  As you might already know, something is wrong with development process of youtube-dl, so yt-dlp forked now.
  You can place and rename it's executable file instead of original youtube-dl and it should work out of the box.
  Also it uses atleast python 3.6, so take care of it. Sometimes you might need to edit file to replace its header from python to python3.6 for some systems.
